# Project: Building a Webpage from Scratch 🌐

This project involves creating a webpage from scratch, starting with the **HTML structure** and now focusing on **styling** the page using **CSS**. The goal is to take the HTML structure created earlier and apply the design and styling based on the provided Figma file. 🎨

## Objectives 🎯

- **Complete the styling** of the webpage using **CSS**. 🖌️
- Apply layout techniques such as **Flexbox** and **Grid** to organize the content. ⚙️
- Use **responsive design** to ensure the webpage looks good on all screen sizes. 📱💻
- **Refine typography** (fonts, sizes, etc.) to match the Figma design. ✍️

## Steps to Follow 📝

1. **Access the Figma File**: You will receive a link to the Figma design. Review it to understand the design details, including fonts, colors, layout, and spacing. 📂
2. **Apply Styling**:
   - Implement the styles for each section based on the Figma design. 🏗️
   - Use **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for layout management. 🔲
   - Make the page **responsive** to adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). 📱
   - Apply **typography** and **color schemes** as per the Figma design. 🖋️
3. **Validate Your CSS**: Ensure your CSS is clean and error-free by validating your code with tools like [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). ✅
4. **Test Responsiveness**: Use the browser's developer tools to test how the webpage looks on different devices. 📱

│   └── style.css       # Main stylesheet for the page 🎨
└── README.md           # Project documentation 📚
```

## Notes ⚠️
- No JavaScript: At this stage, there is no interactivity, just styling with CSS. 🖱️❌
- Responsive Design: Ensure that the webpage works well on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). 📱💻
- CSS Frameworks: You may use CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap if needed, but focus on customizing the styles based on the design. 🎨

## Conclusion 🎉
This project is a critical step toward creating a complete, responsive webpage. After finalizing the CSS, we’ll continue with JavaScript integration for interactive features in the following steps. 🚀
