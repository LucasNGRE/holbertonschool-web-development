# Project: Building a Webpage from Scratch 🌐

This project involves creating a webpage from scratch, based on a design provided in Figma. The goal is to build **the HTML structure** of the page, without focusing on CSS or styling for now. 🎨

## Objectives 🎯

- Create the **HTML structure** of the page, based on the Figma design. 📄
- Use **semantic HTML elements** (such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.). 🧑‍💻
- No **styling (CSS)** or **interactivity (JavaScript)** for this project. 🚫

## Steps to Follow 📝

1. **Access the Figma File**: You will receive a link to the Figma design. Create an account and duplicate the file to your drafts. 📂
2. **Build the HTML Structure**:
   - Implement the main sections (header, navigation, main content, footer, etc.). 🏗️
   - Use semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and organization. 🔑
3. **Validate Your HTML**: Ensure your HTML is valid using a validator (e.g., [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)). ✅

## Project Structure 🗂️

```plaintext

├── index.html          # Main HTML file 📄
├── assets/             # Folder for images, icons, etc. 🖼️
│   └── logo.png
└── README.md           # Project documentation 📚

## Notes ⚠️

- No CSS for now: This project focuses solely on the HTML structure. 🎨🚫
- No JavaScript: There will be no interactive features at this stage. 🖱️❌

## Conclusion 🎉
This project is the first step in building a complete webpage. Once the HTML structure is done, we’ll add styling (CSS) and functionality (JavaScript) in the following steps. 🚀
